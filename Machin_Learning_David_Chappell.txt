Machine Learning;
*****************
- Find patterns in data
- Uses the patterns to predict the future

Example;
********
- Detecting credit card fraud
- Determining whheter a customer is likely to switch to a competitor
- Deciding when to do preventive maintenance on a factory robot
	- Find patterns to predict when the robot is going to fail
	
Learning;
*********
Ex: How did you learn to read?

Learning requires;
	- Identifying patterns (letters, words,...)
	- Recognizing those patterns when you see them again
	
Ex: Analyze the data below and find an abstract pattern;
	Name	Amount	Fraudulent
	Smith	$2600	No
	Potter	$2300	Yes
	Peters	$1000	Yes
	Adams	$8400	No
	
	What is the pattern for Fraudulent transactions?
	- If the name starting with 'p', they are criminal (Silly)
	- If the ammount lower then 2400 (or a limit), then should be criminal?
	
	Data is very low, and with low parameter and low data, finding pattern is more easy but useless.
	
	If the data parameters and data values are too much, then it's hard to find a pattern for a human
	but for a computer, it will be more easy and the pattern will probably more useful. That's machine learning.
	
	
Machine Learning in a Nutshell;
*******************************
- Start with a data that contains patterns
- Use a Machine Learning Algorithm that finds patterns in the data
- Algorithm generates a Model. Functionality is recognizing patterns when feed with new data
- Applications will supply new data to see if it matches with known patterns

Data ==> Machine Learning Algorithm ==> Model <==> Application

- Algo finds patterns
- Model is generated
- Application sends new data, model recognizes patterns

1) Banking transactions occur, these are data
2) Algo finds 3 different fraud pattern in the data
3) Model generated based on 3 patterns
4) With new data, frauds based on three patterns found!

Why is machine learning so hot now?
***********************************
	Machine Learning requires;
		
	Lots of data (we are in the big data era)
	Lots of compute power (we are in the cloud era)
	Effective machine learning algorithms (already studied enough for years and still hot)
	
Machine Larning;
****************
Machine learnig lets us find patterns in existing data, then create and use a model that recognizes 
those patterns in new data.

Machine learning has gone mainstream;
	- Big vendors think there's big money in this market

Machine learning can probably help your organization

The First Problem: Asing the Right Question;
********************************************
	- Choosing what question to ask is the most important part of the process
	- Ask yourself: Do you have the right data to answer this question?
	- Ask yourself: Do you know how you'll measure success?

Machine Learning Process;
*************************
    
	----------------------------------------------------- ITERATE WHOLE JOB TO UPDATE MODEL REGULARLY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                       (Multiple Algorithms)
	Raw Data -> [Data Preprocessing Modules] Apply preprocessing to data -> Prepared Data -> Apply Learning Algo to Data -> Candidate Model -> Deploy Chosen Model -> Choosen Model -> Applications
				***************** ITERATE HERE TO REFINE DATA ***************************    ******* Iterate to find the best model *******
